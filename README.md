This meets all the requirements specified in Assignment 2! I worked alone.

The program creates UV spheres and rings, and applies lighting and texture as specified
It also has capabilities for viewport manipulation as well as toggling the orbit paths

The only things I could improve on are skewing the orbit paths to match exactly,
not just when looked at from above. I also wasn't able to get the moons to orbit around Earth and Jupiter.
That was a problem from last assignment. However, I did get Earth's moon to render after realzing I simply
forgot one parameter from its initialization. 

Very cool project, I'll probably come back to it to add better controls and realism (elliptical orbits, gravity...)

Thanks for an insightful quarter, and have a nice summer.
