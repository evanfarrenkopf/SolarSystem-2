This program allows the user to fly around a solar system and manipulate the viewport between bird's eye view and ship's eye view.

It also supports toggling the orbit paths.

This is my first large JavaScript, OpenGL project and it was intended to culminate learnings in Computer Graphics.

I could improve on are skewing the orbit paths to match exactly, not just when looked at from above. 

I also wasn't able to get the moons to orbit around Earth and Jupiter.

Very cool project, I'll probably come back to it to add better controls and realism (elliptical orbits, gravity... black holes??)
